        "lead": "<p>Insiders predict agricultural companies could become major adopters of solar power in Africa as farmers seek to improve the cost and reliability of energy supplies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greencape.co.za/assets/Uploads/SUSTAINABLE-AGRICULTURE-MIR-2019-WEB-01-04-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a report</a>&nbsp;from GreenCape, a non-profit organization, the market for renewable energy in agriculture last year&nbsp;was worth up to 960 million South African Rand&nbsp;($61 million at today&rsquo;s rates) in South Africa alone.</p>\n\n<p>One in 10 South African solar installations were in the agricultural sector, said the report, and the market was expected to grow at 10 percent a year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Frank Spencer, a board member at the South African Photovoltaic Industry Association (SAPVIA), said solar was seeing &ldquo;exponential growth&rdquo; in the agricultural sector.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The electricity demand and supply profiles of the agriculture sector make solar PV a perfect fit,&rdquo; he said in an email. &ldquo;We envisage this trend to continue as solar PV technology matures and the costs continue to decrease.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Given the cost and reliability of solar generation during the day in Africa, &ldquo;this kind of application is applicable wherever there is daytime usage of electricity throughout the year,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>While &lsquo;agricultural solar&rsquo; elsewhere tends to refer to the co-location of PV projects on the same land where crops grow or livestock grazes, in Africa the location aspect isn&rsquo;t key. Instead, it&rsquo;s the fact that businesses mainly use solar electricity to pump irrigation water and to chill produce before shipping.</p>\n\n<h2>Solar as a source of low-cost,&nbsp;reliable power&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>In both situations, PV can be more reliable than grid supplies and cheaper than diesel generation, said Edwin Masimba Moyo, executive chairman at Nhimbe Fresh Exports of Zimbabwe, in an interview.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One of Africa&rsquo;s top exporters of blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and peas, Nhimbe Fresh has been blighted <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-land-of-opportunity-for-off-grid-energy\" target=\"_blank\">by grid outages</a> that can take up to weeks to sort out, leading to loss of irrigation or spoilage of goods that have to be refrigerated after picking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Until now, Nhimbe has relied on diesel gensets to ride through grid outages. But the cost of diesel can be significant&mdash;up to $800,000 a year. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big number,&rdquo; Moyo said.</p>\n\n<p>To overcome this problem, Nhimbe is procuring around 1.9 megawatts of solar plus a 3.9 megawatt-hour battery system for its farm, pump sites, pack house and cold store.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The system is being procured via Sun Exchange, a <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ci-solar-investment-holds-up-as-covid-19-hits-africa\" target=\"_blank\">peer-to-peer solar leasing</a> platform that allows international&nbsp;investors to buy into PV projects for commercial and industrial-scale customers in Africa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Nhimbe is Sun Exchange&rsquo;s second foray into agri-PV, following a project to install a 473-kilowatt system at Boland Cellar, one of South Africa&rsquo;s largest wine companies. The PV system delivers a quarter of Boland&rsquo;s energy requirements, cutting its electricity bill by 34 percent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Until recently, Sun Exchange has focused on schools and small business projects,&rdquo; said the platform&rsquo;s founder, Abe Cambridge, in an email. &ldquo;But in the last quarter alone, we&rsquo;ve hosted crowd sales for two agribusinesses, with more in the pipeline.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Solar is fast becoming an important tool for reducing the operational costs of African farms, he said. &ldquo;Many farm activities take place during the day, when solar power is readily available,&rdquo; he commented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Having a solar system perfectly aligns with the operational nature of farms, significantly reducing power requirements. Many farms have cold stores and these tend to require the most energy during the day or when it is hot, which also happens to be when solar generation is at its highest.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<h2>New funding models to unlock fallow capacity</h2>\n\n<p>Moyo said Sun Exchange&rsquo;s funding model had been key in enabling Nhimbe to move to solar. The benefit of the concept is that the upfront costs of purchase and installation are borne by Sun Exchange investors, who then profit from electricity payments made by the customer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This allows farms and agribusinesses to go solar with no equipment, installation, insurance or ongoing operational costs,&rdquo; said Cambridge, and &ldquo;results in an immediate energy cost reduction of at least 20 percent, and average savings of over 40 percent over the full 20-year lease term.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Other procurement options are available, of course. SAPVIA&rsquo;s Spencer said the most common model was to purchase a solar system outright, with a payback of between three and five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Another model that may be viable for agricultural PV in South Africa is the Property Assessed Clean Energy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/slsc/property-assessed-clean-energy-programs\" target=\"_blank\">scheme</a>, which allows asset owners to finance the upfront cost of energy and then pay the costs back over time through a voluntary assessment and with debt tied to property.</p>\n\n<h2>Mixing solar with crops vs. rooftop, greenfield alternatives&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Access to finance will be likely to further increase agri-PV&rsquo;s momentum in Africa. But it remains to be seen whether the alleged benefits of pairing PV with farming can be replicated in other parts of the world &mdash;&nbsp;particularly where solar panels are sited directly on farmland.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One BloombergNEF study in China, where several gigawatts of PV are co-located with agriculture, found the main reason for the pairing was limited land availability in regions with strong electricity demand and grid resources. The situation wasn&rsquo;t optimal for farming or for PV, the study found.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The problem with a global analysis of anything to do with agriculture is it differs by the climatic conditions, the crop you want to grow [and] the availability of labor and machinery,&rdquo; Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at BloombergNEF, wrote in an email. &ldquo;It can even differ by year.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>As a result, she said, when it comes to agriculture and PV, &ldquo;I am cautious, and for now think that the best place to put solar panels is on an opaque roof that you know will be standing for at least 30 years.&rdquo;</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=_Eya6eHJN1E:wnLks7gz_k4:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=_Eya6eHJN1E:wnLks7gz_k4:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=_Eya6eHJN1E:wnLks7gz_k4:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=_Eya6eHJN1E:wnLks7gz_k4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=_Eya6eHJN1E:wnLks7gz_k4:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~4/_Eya6eHJN1E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

It brings Form Energy&#39;s total funds raised to around $120 million, a hefty sum for a novel technology that&#39;s still a few years away from its first commercial deployment.</p>\n\n<p>Lithium-ion batteries dominate nearly all the grid storage that is being installed today, but that technology&#39;s&nbsp;cost-effectiveness&nbsp;wanes in applications geared to&nbsp;store&nbsp;energy for many hours or days.&nbsp;Entrepreneurs have pursued a motley crew of alternatives to turn wind and solar power into baseload power plants: things like flow batteries of various chemistries, gravity-based systems that mimic pumped hydro storage&nbsp;and compressed air in caverns or tanks. But the long-duration storage sector has produced more bankruptcies and delays than surefire successes.</p>\n\n<p><em>See GTM&#39;s previous coverage: <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/so-what-exactly-is-long-duration-storage-explained\" target=\"_blank\">So, what exactly is long-duration energy storage?</a></em></p>\n\n<p>Form Energy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/inside-form-energy-star-studded-startup-tackling-hardest-problem-in-clean#gs.xux972\" target=\"_blank\">burst onto the scene</a> in 2018&nbsp;with a founding team of veteran energy storage leaders, including co-founder Mateo Jaramillo, the&nbsp;former director of Tesla&#39;s stationary storage business. It launched with a $9 million Series A backed by&nbsp;Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Prelude Ventures, Macquarie Capital, Saudi Aramco, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology offshoot The Engine.</p>\n\n<p>The company&nbsp;scoured the known energy-storing materials for ingredients that could deliver days or weeks of storage at radically lower cost than lithium-ion. Initially, the founders told Greentech Media that their path to commercialization could <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/inside-form-energy-star-studded-startup-tackling-hardest-problem-in-clean#gs.xux972\" target=\"_blank\">take a decade</a>&nbsp;&mdash; a decidedly sober approach compared to the&nbsp;rosy projections other startups in the space had touted.</p>\n\n<p>But Form&#39;s activities quickly began to pick&nbsp;up speed. It raised a <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/form-fenergy-series-b-long-duration-energy-storage\" target=\"_blank\">$40&nbsp;million Series B</a> in 2019, bringing in strategic investors such as&nbsp;Italian oil and gas giant Eni. That funding came after Form developed a \"fully functioning cell that was hitting the technical marks,\" Jaramillo told GTM at the time. The Series B funding was earmarked for&nbsp;scaling&nbsp;up the cell by 10 to 100 times and turning it into a fully engineered product, he noted.</p>\n\n<p>In the spring of 2020, Form won its first publicly acknowledged contract: a <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/form-energys-first-project-pushes-long-duration-storage-to-new-heights-150-hour-duration\" target=\"_blank\">1-megawatt/150-megawatt-hour \"aqueous air\" system</a> for Minnesota utility Great River Energy, due in 2023. A 1 MW battery no longer draws attention, but nothing on the market had come close to 150 hours of duration for megawatt-scale discharge.</p>\n\n<p>The $70 million round arrives as Form looks to broader commercialization for a product that it believes has market pull in the next few years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Throughout all this, Form has kept the nature of its technology a closely held secret. Though some media outlets describe it as sulfur chemistry, Jaramillo previously clarified to Greentech Media that his team worked on an aqueous sulfur flow battery chemistry and an undisclosed electrochemical solution. They ultimately chose to commercialize the latter, while pursuing the sulfur technology with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arpa-e.energy.gov/technologies/projects/aqueous-sulfur-systems-long-duration-grid-storage\" target=\"_blank\">research and development grant</a> from the Department of Energy, indicating a longer pathway to market for that design, which suffers from low round-trip efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>The market for&nbsp;long-duration storage is still coming into existence, but a few developments signaled greater traction taking hold this year. California&#39;s energy regulator called for <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/california-we-need-1gw-long-duration-storage-by-2026\" target=\"_blank\">1 gigawatt of long-duration storage</a> to be installed in the state by 2026. In October, a&nbsp;group of community-choice aggregators in California launched&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-first-long-duration-storage-procurement-has-arrived\" target=\"_blank\">first major&nbsp;solicitation</a> dedicated to long-duration energy storage. Earlier this month, liquid air storage company Highview Power recently began construction on a 50 MW/250 MWh&nbsp;plant near Manchester, which will test the economic viability of that technology in the U.K. power markets.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=5wPsqxMb38M:OdRVeNFexIo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=5wPsqxMb38M:OdRVeNFexIo:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=5wPsqxMb38M:OdRVeNFexIo:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=5wPsqxMb38M:OdRVeNFexIo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=5wPsqxMb38M:OdRVeNFexIo:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~4/5wPsqxMb38M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

        "lead": "<p>Electric school buses just might&nbsp;be the breakout vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology in the United States. At least, that&rsquo;s how Duncan McIntyre, CEO of Highland Electric Transportation, sees it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>McIntyre, who&nbsp;founded&nbsp;renewable energy procurement and analysis marketplace Altenex in 2011 and sold it to Edison International in 2015, started Highland Electric two years ago to build a &ldquo;business entirely around the school bus electrification market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The idea is to replace the upfront and ongoing costs of EV buses and charging infrastructure with a fixed annual fee, equal to or less than a school district&rsquo;s current budget for owning, fueling and maintaining their existing diesel-fueled fleets. Highland finances the arrangement and recoups the investment by finding ways to earn money from the new fleet&rsquo;s battery capacity when the buses are&nbsp;not on the road.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A major part of that equation relies on tapping their energy storage capacity for soaking up low-cost overnight or midday power &mdash; and more importantly, discharging it during grid-stressed evening peaks. That&rsquo;s the big difference between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-is-vehicle-to-grid-taking-so-long-to-happen\" target=\"_blank\">V2G technologies</a>, which actively tap EV batteries, and the far more common &ldquo;V1G&rdquo; approach of simply throttling or halting EV charging to reduce grid impacts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Out of all the EVs out there, &ldquo;we think electric school buses are the killer V2G app,&rdquo; McIntyre said in an interview last week. Not only do the nearly 500,000 school buses in North America spend most of their time parked, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re idle in the middle of the day, they&rsquo;re idle in the evening, and they&rsquo;re idle all summer,&rdquo; a schedule that fits almost perfectly with emerging grid needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Why V2G has been slow to take off&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p>Vehicle-to-grid isn&rsquo;t a novel technology in the U.S. One of the most widespread V2G technology platforms today was initially developed at the University of Delaware&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/can-nuvve-make-v2g-work-in-the-real-world\" target=\"_blank\">back in 2007</a>. San Diego-based Nuvve has built that foundational technology into a platform orchestrating EV grid services in Europe, Japan and the U.S., including a commercial V2G operation in Denmark that&rsquo;s been running&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nuvve.com/four-years-of-consecutive-v2g-in-denmark/\" target=\"_blank\">for four years</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Europe is home to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-european-evs-are-balancing-out-the-renewables-that-power-them\" target=\"_blank\">multiple V2G projects</a>&nbsp;actively bidding into energy markets. But in the U.S., V2G opportunities have been limited by a number of factors,&nbsp;said&nbsp;Jacqueline Piero, Nuvve&rsquo;s vice president of policy.&nbsp;Adding bidirectional power flow adds complications that&nbsp;state interconnection regulations and U.S. grid operator market structures aren&rsquo;t designed to handle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But these bottlenecks have started to open. California recently revised its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/californias-interconnection-rules-open-doors-to-flexible-solar-storage-vehicle-to-grid-charging#:~:text=The%20new%20Rule%2021%20revisions%20clarify%20that%20V2G%20DC%20charging,be%20interconnected%20with%20utility%20permission.&amp;text=As%20for%20V2G%20AC%20charging,be%20ready%20to%20standardize%20it.\" target=\"_blank\">interconnection rules to include V2G</a>&nbsp;systems, laying the groundwork for broader adoption, she said. Mid-Atlantic grid operator PJM has followed up its University of Delaware V2G pilots with tests with BMW and General Motors and is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://insidelines.pjm.com/dominion-to-roll-out-largest-electric-school-bus-deployment-in-u-s/\" target=\"_blank\">participating in a pilot</a>&nbsp;launched by Virginia utility Dominion Energy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In March, Highland Electric Transportation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/city-of-beverly-and-highland-electric-transportation-select-electric-school-bus-from-thomas-built-buses-powered-by-proterra-ev-technology-301014159.html\" target=\"_blank\">landed its first deal</a>&nbsp;with the city of Beverly, Massachusetts&nbsp;to supply Thomas Built Buses&rsquo;&nbsp;electric buses powered by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/3-trends-making-the-case-for-bus-electrification\" target=\"_blank\">Proterra&rsquo;s electric drivetrains</a>&nbsp;and charged with Proterra&rsquo;s 60-kilowatt charging stations. Highland is working with utility National Grid to tap its lucrative energy storage pay-for-performance incentives, and it is also exploring opportunities from grid operator ISO New England&rsquo;s emergency response program, McIntyre said.</p>\n\n<p>Nuvve, which announced&nbsp;plans this week to go public via a special-purpose acquisition vehicle <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nuvve-electric-vehicle-to-grid-charging-pioneer-to-go-public-via-spac-reverse-merger\" target=\"_blank\">reverse&nbsp;merger</a>, has recently started <a href=\"https://nuvve.com/nuvve-corporation-announces-participation-in-californias-wholesale-energy-markets-to-help-balance-the-grid/\" target=\"_blank\">bidding stationary battery capacity</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;the University of California at San Diego&#39;s microgrid into California state grid operator CAISO markets,&nbsp;as a precursor to tapping the microgrid&#39;s growing&nbsp;EV fleet. But not all EVs are well suited to taking part in V2G to moneymaking opportunities, Piero noted. First and foremost, EVs have &ldquo;a&nbsp;primary use that can&rsquo;t be compromised&rdquo; &mdash; serving the transportation needs of their owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Most U.S. EV charging systems today offer incentives for&nbsp;EVs to charge with cheap and plentiful off-peak energy&nbsp;and to avoid charging when grid demand is at its peak. That will be critical to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/southern-california-edison-38000-ev-chargers-largest-utility-program-of-its-kind\" target=\"_blank\">managing the grid impacts</a>&nbsp;of an EV fleet that&rsquo;s set to grow to tens of millions of vehicles in the coming decade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But EVs may not have much excess battery capacity and can face significant customer and automaker resistance to adding stress to a battery whose long-time health is critical to maintaining vehicle range and value.</p>\n\n<p>School buses, by contrast, can carry batteries with excess capacity to provide to the grid. Proterra&rsquo;s 220-kilowatt batteries for Thomas Built school buses are capable of more than&nbsp;4,000 cycles over eight years, which means that &ldquo;more than half of their use case could be for use as a grid asset,&rdquo; CTO Dustin&nbsp;Grace said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Most EVs also charge at unpredictable times and locations, making it hard to align their capabilities with the constructs of the traditional energy market and utility programs.&nbsp;EV fleets, by contrast, offer&nbsp;scale that multiplies their value&nbsp;and a single owner that can commit them to being available when they&rsquo;re most valuable to the grid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Utilities and&nbsp;public-private partnerships are targeting the electric school bus opportunity</h2>\n\n<p>School buses fill a unique niche in the world of fleet vehicles, Piero noted. First of all, they&rsquo;re an almost completely North American phenomenon, as most other countries rely on public transit or other transportation methods for students.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Second, they&rsquo;re owned by school districts or city and county agencies open to a variety of public-private partnerships. Nuvve has been participating in California Energy Commission-funded school bus V2G pilot projects in the Southern California school districts of <a href=\"https://nuvve.com/projects/torrance-electric-school-buses/\" target=\"_blank\">Torrance</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/06/f52/elt095_moore_2018_o.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Rialto</a>, partnering with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.electrive.com/2020/09/16/v2g-charging-with-electric-school-buses-in-the-usa/\" target=\"_blank\">bus maker Blue Bird</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>An electric school bus still costs about $120,000 more than its diesel equivalent upfront&nbsp;but will save its owner about&nbsp;$170,000 to $240,000 in lifetime fuel and maintenance costs, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/school-districts-rolling-out-electric-buses\">a 2018 report</a>&nbsp;from the&nbsp;U.S. Public Interest Research Group. Multiple avenues are emerging to bridge the resulting gap between upfront costs and long-term payback.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The California Energy Commission&rsquo;s School Bus Replacement Program&nbsp;has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/school-bus-replacement-program\" target=\"_blank\">dedicated&nbsp;$94 million</a>&nbsp;to help cover conversion costs for eligible districts or agencies. States including Vermont, Minnesota, Arizona and Michigan have set aside EV bus funds from their shares of Volkswagen&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/volkswagens-electrify-america-breaks-ground-on-ev-charging-network-faces-sc\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion Dieselgate</a>&nbsp;settlement.

        "lead": "<p>Two of Europe&rsquo;s major utilities have demonstrated the signs of a post-coronavirus lockdown recovery, highlighted by&nbsp;growing renewables capacities.</p>\n\n<p>EDF and RWE both reported their Q3 results at the end of last week. While COVID-19 lockdowns have&nbsp;trimmed demand for electricity over the period, sustained renewables deployment and the associated revenue were bright spots for both companies.</p>\n\n<p>RWE said it expected to complete 800 megawatts of wind and solar deployments in Q4, on top of the 500 MW already commissioned. It expects its wind and solar capacity to reach 10 gigawatts by the end of the year, on its way to&nbsp;a 13 GW target by&nbsp;2022.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The changing generation mix of the German company has been laid bare in the first nine months of 2020. The combined output of the firm&rsquo;s lignite and hard coal plants is&nbsp;down by more than one-third in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the same period last year. The output from wind and solar, meanwhile, nearly tripled from 6.1 billion kilowatt-hours to 17.1 billion kilowatt-hours.</p>\n\n<p>This trend will continue as <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/rwe-eyes-tech-innovation-as-it-accelerates-renewables-roll-out\" target=\"_blank\">Germany&rsquo;s coal phaseout</a> continues and RWE adds more renewable capacity. In September it won <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/uk-offshore-wind-pipeline-passes-50gw\" target=\"_blank\">1.8 GW of new seabed leases</a> for offshore wind projects in the U.K. In the first week of November, it closed the &euro;400 million ($473 million) deal to acquire an onshore wind and solar pipeline of 2.7 GW from wind turbine manufacturer&nbsp;Nordex. The majority of the projects, 1.9 GW worth, are in France.</p>\n\n<p>In revenue terms, the company made &euro;1.6 billion ($1.9 billion) of revenue from its wind and solar assets in the first nine months (9M) of&nbsp;2020 compared to &euro;743 million ($879 million) in the first nine months of last year.</p>\n\n<h2>EDF&rsquo;s pipeline swells</h2>\n\n<p>EDF posted a decrease in sales of 4&nbsp;percent to &euro;48.8 billion ($57.8 billion)&nbsp;for 9M 2020 compared to &euro;51.0 billion in 9M 2019. According to EDF, sales would have been &ldquo;almost stable&rdquo; if the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic are accounted for.</p>\n\n<p>Gloomy forecasts for the EDF&rsquo;s nuclear output have partly recovered over the course of 2020, with an increase announced in Q3 to 325 to 335 terawatt-hours. In April, that figure was&nbsp;reduced to 300 TWh. Before COVID-19 took hold, the forecast had been 395 TWh.</p>\n\n<p>As with RWE, renewables offered some welcome good news.</p>\n\n<p>The company is currently targeting a total renewables portfolio of 50 GW by 2030. In February, Jean-Bernard L&eacute;vy, EDF&rsquo;s chairman and CEO, said it would revisit that target because &ldquo;it really looks like we are going to exceed it, and by quite a significant gap.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>EDF, which is majority-owned by the French government, has amassed a global portfolio of 32.5 GW of renewables, including 9.8 GW of wind and solar and 22.3 GW of hydropower. According to figures released alongside its Q3 results, the current wind and solar pipeline totals 39.1 GW, with 14.2 GW in North America and 15.4 GW in Europe. It is widely expected that solar and wind will provide the majority of the remaining capacity.</p>\n\n<p>In October, EDF Renewables acquired the 4.5 GW solar development pipeline of Geenex, located in PJM territory.</p>\n\n<p>In India, its Eden Renewables business won 1,350 MW of solar capacity in Rajasthan. It also commenced construction on a 400 MW onshore wind project in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<h2>Investment outlook on the rise</h2>\n\n<p>RWE noted that 85 percent of its investment in 2020 has been \"green,\" which it defines as any project adhering to the criteria set forth in the EU&rsquo;s \"taxonomy rules.\"</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s a critical issue with hundreds of billions of euros&#39; worth of green stimulus funding up for grabs. Most recently, natural gas has been denied the status as a &ldquo;transition fuel.&rdquo; Anything with 100 grams of CO2 equivalent per kWh won&rsquo;t be considered sustainable. That figure is linked to the threshold required to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>\n\n<p>RWE CFO and CEO-elect Markus Krebber told an investor analyst call that the financing outlook for renewables is improving.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We see lower cost of capital because we have had low interest rates for a long time, and they could go lower,&rdquo; said Krebber, explaining that its cost of capital is calculated using average interest rates over six- to 18-month periods.</p>\n\n<p>As renewable technologies mature and deployment builds out megawatts&#39; worth of capacity as well as experience for those involved, the cost of the risks involved fall.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to feel more comfortable with the risk profile once you have done five or six offshore construction projects with the same partner,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n<p>Krebber also said that the profit levels had now&nbsp;stabilized for projects, with those bidding more aggressively in auctions unlikely to meet investors&rsquo; demands for returns. The end result is that RWE is not too concerned about funding its renewables surge, while also expecting the value of its development pipeline to grow in a positive financial environment.</p>\n\n<p>RWE launched a capital raise in August, increasing the volume of its shares by 10 percent and raising &euro;2 billion in the process. In its quarterly report, RWE said the proceeds of the deal would be used to implement projects from the Nordex pipeline.</p>\n\n<p>RWE has also been developing a \"green bond\" framework to fund wind and solar projects. In April, three European utilities, EDP, EnBW and SSE, all <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/european-utilities-tap-bond-market-to-help-ride-out-coronavirus-volatility-57962893\" target=\"_blank\">issued their own green bonds</a> and raised &euro;2.5 billion in total. Engie, E.ON, Iberdrola and offshore wind developer &Oslash;rsted have also launched green bonds this year.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=q9llPHmsQUI:eannIZxzSNM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=q9llPHmsQUI:eannIZxzSNM:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=q9llPHmsQUI:eannIZxzSNM:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=q9llPHmsQUI:eannIZxzSNM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=q9llPHmsQUI:eannIZxzSNM:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~4/q9llPHmsQUI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

        "lead": "<p>Desert energy is back. As the European Union sets its sights on a green hydrogen boom as part of its plans to meet decarbonization pledges and rebuild economies ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic, North Africa has emerged&nbsp;as&nbsp;a possible source for a significant chunk of Europe&rsquo;s future hydrogen<sub> </sub>supply.</p>\n\n<p>A 2020 version of the European Commission&rsquo;s hydrogen strategy&nbsp;referenced a proposal that the EU could meet some of its future supply from neighboring countries such as Ukraine, as well as the desert regions of North Africa, which offer both huge renewables potential and geographic proximity.</p>\n\n<p>The idea originated in a paper published in March by trade body Hydrogen Europe&nbsp;setting out the&nbsp;\"<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/eu-sets-green-hydrogen-targets-now-blue-hydrogen-has-to-keep-up\" target=\"_blank\">2 x 40 GW</a> green hydrogen initiative.\" Under this concept, the EU by 2030 would&nbsp;have in place 40 gigawatts&nbsp;of domestic renewable hydrogen electrolyzer capacity and import a further 40 GW from electrolyzers in neighboring areas, among them the deserts of North Africa, via revamped versions of the natural-gas pipelines that already connect to Europe.</p>\n\n<p>If it sounds like a familiar idea, that&rsquo;s because it isn&rsquo;t entirely new. A little over a decade ago, a similar plan enjoyed its moment in the sun when a coalition of industrial corporations and finance institutions joined forces to push what was dubbed the <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/desertec-update-funding\" target=\"_blank\">Desertec concept</a>. At one stage, RWE, Siemens and First Solar were all involved.&nbsp;The thinking behind Desertec was that up to 20 percent of Europe&rsquo;s energy needs could be met with&nbsp;huge solar and wind arrays located in the Sahara, brought into the bloc via a trans-Mediterranean high-voltage power network.</p>\n\n<p>For a few years, Desertec generated hyperbolic headlines about the Sahara eventually providing clean power for the entire world. But the venture ultimately foundered amid criticism that it would have been an excessively&nbsp;costly boondoggle underpinned by&nbsp;outdated notions of Africa&rsquo;s natural resources being up for&nbsp;grabs by the rest of the world.</p>\n\n<p>However, this&nbsp;idea now seems to have been granted&nbsp;a new lease of life, this time as the possible answer to Europe&rsquo;s renewable hydrogen needs. Some of the thinking can be traced back to the legacy organization of the Desertec initiative, Dii, which addressed the proposal in a North Africa-Europe hydrogen \"<a href=\"https://dii-desertenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Dii-hydrogen-study-November-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">manifesto</a>\"&nbsp;document&nbsp;published last year. One of the&nbsp;authors of that manifesto&nbsp;also co-wrote Hydrogen Europe&rsquo;s 2 x 40 GW initiative paper.</p>\n\n<h2>Underestimating Europe&rsquo;s renewables potential</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps because of Desertec&#39;s decidedly mixed legacy, the idea of a renewable hydrogen superhighway between Europe and Africa has garnered&nbsp;a lukewarm reception, attracting similar objections to those aimed at its predecessor, mainly around cost and practicality.</p>\n\n<p>According to Aur&eacute;lie Beauvais, head of policy and deputy CEO of trade body SolarPower Europe, the idea of an EU-Africa hydrogen mega-project is something of a &ldquo;chimera&rdquo; based on what she says is a misconception that Europe lacks abundant&nbsp;renewable energy resources.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is based on a bit of a prehistoric vision that you only have solar in the south&nbsp;and you only have wind in the north, whereas [in&nbsp;truth] resources are much better distributed,&rdquo; said Beauvais, citing a study by SolarPower Europe and Finland&rsquo;s LUT University published earlier in the year showing Europe&rsquo;s renewables potential to be &ldquo;immense.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The EU is heavily underestimating their resources in renewable electricity,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n\n<p>Preoccupation with the idea that Europe will not be able to meet its envisioned&nbsp;future demand for renewable hydrogen with domestic resources overlooks the potential for innovation in decentralized solutions, Beauvais argues. With these types of innovations, renewable hydrogen could be&nbsp;both produced and consumed locally&nbsp;&ldquo;without the need for huge plants or huge pipes.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are at the beginning of a revolution, so it&#39;s a moment where we need to encourage technology and innovation, and decentralized production of hydrogen is very interesting because it does not require the same amount of infrastructure,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n\n<h2>Pipelines or pipe dreams?</h2>\n\n<p>This echoes concerns voiced by others about the idea of Europe relying on renewable hydrogen produced overseas and the logistics of transporting&nbsp;the fuel to market.</p>\n\n<p>As Wood Mackenzie analyst Ben Gallagher has pointed&nbsp;out, hydrogen has&nbsp;low volumetric energy density compared to&nbsp;natural gas, which makes its&nbsp;transportation more of a challenge. &ldquo;It would need to be highly pressurized, liquefied [or] turned into <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-firm-unveils-worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-project\" target=\"_blank\">ammonia</a>,&nbsp;or...some other carrier [would have to be used] for transportation,&rdquo; Gallagher said. &ldquo;Currently, hydrogen is compressed and put on trucks, but that&#39;s for pretty small-scale distribution; it&#39;s never been done on a large scale.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Martin Lambert, a senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, agreed&nbsp;that the cost of transporting hydrogen produced in North Africa or elsewhere through repurposed natural-gas pipelines would be substantial. &ldquo;You need to do some quite deep engineering work to convert a gas pipeline system to hydrogen; hydrogen is quite different stuff to methane, so you can&#39;t convert it easily,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n<p>Lambert is broadly supportive of the idea of tapping the potential of regions such as the Sahara to either supply power directly to Europe or produce renewable hydrogen. But he&nbsp;questioned&nbsp;the feasibility of the timescales involved and achieving as much as 40 GW of capacity&nbsp;by 2030.</p>\n\n<p>Models of the development of the hydrogen market that Lambert and others have undertaken are more in line with the decentralized approach suggested by SolarPower Europe, building from a few local clusters initially developed around big industrial centers such as Teesside, Humberside or&nbsp;Merseyside in the U.K. or the Ruhr in Germany.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;A few clusters could develop, and from that, you then start to integrate the link between them. To say as a first step you&#39;re going to have massive hydrogen pipelines running across Europe sounds a bit premature,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n<h2>New tech and revived momentum&nbsp;bring renewed optimism</h2>\n\n<p>Still, backers of the concept stand by its aims.</p>\n\n<p>Constantine Levoyannis, Hydrogen Europe&rsquo;s head of policy, agrees&nbsp;that a decentralized approach should be the first focus of the development of a renewable hydrogen market in Europe.&nbsp;But he argues&nbsp;that the huge numbers involved in the energy and industrial &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; the European Commission is proposing&nbsp;in its hydrogen strategy will inevitably require an outward-looking approach to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We want European industry to invest in electrolyzers and help us achieve this objective. On the other hand, we&#39;re cognizant that we don&#39;t have enough space to be able to do more than 40 or 50 GW [within the EU]. So we&#39;re going to need a strategy that engages external parties as well,&rdquo; Levoyannis said.</p>\n\n<p>Levoyannis recognizes&nbsp;that some of the same criticisms lobbed at Desertec are now being made of the 2 x 40 GW initiative, but he emphasizes the extent to which factors such as technological advances, substantially greater political momentum and the dramatic decline&nbsp;in the costs of renewables have created a very different context from&nbsp;the one in which Desertec operated.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;There will always be the naysayers, but I think the facts speak for themselves. It&#39;s a completely different discussion that we&#39;re having today than we were 10 years ago,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n<p>On the question of how renewable hydrogen might be physically transported to market in Europe, Levoyannis acknowledged that&nbsp;significant engineering would indeed be required. But the&nbsp;cost of repurposing existing pipelines to carry hydrogen would still be cheaper than building new ones and more efficient than trying to bring renewable electricity from, say, North Africa into the EU in electron form, he said.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You can transport much more renewable energy via pipeline,&nbsp;as in molecular form, than via the grid,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;The Hydrogen Europe paper claims that&nbsp;transporting hydrogen by pipeline costs 10 to 20 times&nbsp;less than electricity transported by cables.</p>\n\n<p>The inclusion of the 2 x 40 GW initiative in the European Commission&rsquo;s July strategy proposal does not mean that it is official EU policy. But Levoyannis said the fact it was included highlights the extent to which the idea is being taken seriously at the highest levels of&nbsp;the EC. That view is bolstered&nbsp;by activity already underway at a legislative level to pave the way for the development of a hydrogen &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; in Europe to support the hydrogen economy.</p>\n\n<p>Others agree that the EU is right to look beyond its borders if it is serious about hydrogen playing a central role in achieving climate neutrality.</p>\n\n<h2>The plan can bring Africa into the hydrogen economy</h2>\n\n<p>According to Nils R&oslash;kke, chairman of the European Energy Research Alliance, closer collaboration between the EU and Africa in areas such as energy would bring mutual benefits. Those&nbsp;could include&nbsp;enabling&nbsp;Europe to tap into its neighbor&rsquo;s vast renewable energy resources&nbsp;and allowing African countries to enjoy greater domestic energy access as a benefit from that investment.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Africa would be in a much better situation and Europe would be in a much better situation if there was a cooperation between the development of renewable energies and to develop renewable fuels such as hydrogen,&rdquo; R&oslash;kke said. &ldquo;And there will be will be spillover benefits, I&#39;m pretty sure about that; not doing it would be isolating Africa from taking part in the industrial development of these kinds of technologies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>It is far too early to predict whether these factors will be enough to lead to the realization of&nbsp;40 GW of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers in North Africa piping fuel across the Mediterranean. What seems clear is that in official circles at least, there is a growing view that at least some of Europe&rsquo;s future renewable hydrogen needs must be met from outside its own borders.</p>\n\n<p>Already, moves are afoot to mobilize industry to begin finding ways to put the European&nbsp;Commission&rsquo;s plans into action, including the launch of&nbsp;a Clean Hydrogen Alliance to bring together key stakeholders. The EU is also gearing up on the diplomatic front, with commission efforts such as the Africa-Europe Green Energy Initiative exploring opportunities for clean hydrogen collaborations.</p>\n\n<p>As these ventures start to take shape and legislative changes begin laying the foundations for a future clean hydrogen market, a clearer picture should begin to emerge of whether the prospect of a hydrogen revolution substantially powered by the sun and wind of the Sahara is just a mirage or a solid vision of a greener future.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=DsV3U14D86c:v4110OnnsuU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=DsV3U14D86c:v4110OnnsuU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=DsV3U14D86c:v4110OnnsuU:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=DsV3U14D86c:v4110OnnsuU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=DsV3U14D86c:v4110OnnsuU:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~4/DsV3U14D86c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

        "lead": "<p>A major clean energy policy cleared Arizona&#39;s utility regulator&nbsp;and now heads to stakeholder comment before it can take effect.</p>\n\n<p>The Arizona Corporation Commission voted 4-1 Friday to approve a suite of amendments to its energy rules that&nbsp;amount to a systemic commitment to clean energy. The <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/arizona-sets-path-toward-100-percent-clean-power-by-2050\" target=\"_blank\">new rules</a> will&nbsp;require&nbsp;the state&#39;s investor-owned utilities to&nbsp;phase out fossil fuels from the grid by 2050, a goal <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/arizona-public-service-carbon-free-power-2050\" target=\"_blank\">already promised</a> by the state&#39;s largest utility, Arizona Public Service.&nbsp;They also require that energy storage systems make up 5 percent of those utilities&#39; total grid capacity by 2035&nbsp;and that 40 percent of that total be customer-owned or leased.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A few steps remain before&nbsp;the rules are officially implemented, as dictated by the state&#39;s rulemaking procedures. The Arizona secretary of state needs to post the rules for a public comment period. After that, the commission will take&nbsp;a final vote in early 2021. But the hard work of hammering out the policy itself has been finished.</p>\n\n<p>\"The meeting today was to make sure there was a final, clean package that the commissioners were able to look at and adopt,\" said Art Terrazas, who worked on this effort for advocacy group Vote Solar. With the successful vote, the clean-energy policy cake has been baked, he said.</p>\n\n<p>The makeup of the commission will have changed by the time&nbsp;it reconvenes for the final vote.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-rundown-of-the-down-ballot-results-with-clean-energy-implications\" target=\"_blank\">Three seats were up for election</a>&nbsp;on November 3, and&nbsp;two Republicans and one Democrat won those&nbsp;races. That created&nbsp;some uncertainty about the final outcome of the measure.</p>\n\n<p>But the energy rules passed Friday by a 4-to-1 vote.&nbsp;One of the newly elected commissioners, Democrat Anna Tovar, ran on a clean-energy platform.&nbsp;Republican incumbent Lea M&aacute;rquez Peterson won another term, and she joined the majority in Friday&#39;s vote. The numbers suggest a majority will remain in favor of the policy after the new commissioners take their seats.</p>\n\n<p>\"The hard policy work is never done, but this is a big and important step and can be sustained by the new commission,\" said Sandy Bahr, director of the Sierra Club&#39;s Arizona chapter, in an email Friday.</p>\n\n<p>The question of whether or not to move away from fossil fuels became a flashpoint in the final days of the presidential election. But in Arizona, a longtime Republican stronghold that flipped for Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election, the politics of clean energy do not mirror the national political discourse. With ample sunlight and a dry climate, solar paired with batteries began&nbsp;beating out new gas plants in competitive solicitations back in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>\"The economics are now matching up with what&rsquo;s also best for the environment,\" Terrazas said. \"There&rsquo;s broad bipartisan consensus that that is where we&rsquo;re going to go.\"</p>\n\n<p><em>For more details on&nbsp;Arizona&#39;s clean energy overhaul, see GTM&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/arizona-sets-path-toward-100-percent-clean-power-by-2050\" target=\"_blank\">previous reporting</a>.</em></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=GNlcfMIiiDY:-cC9MIvz1Zk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=GNlcfMIiiDY:-cC9MIvz1Zk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=GNlcfMIiiDY:-cC9MIvz1Zk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=GNlcfMIiiDY:-cC9MIvz1Zk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=GNlcfMIiiDY:-cC9MIvz1Zk:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~4/GNlcfMIiiDY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

        "lead": "<p>It seems everyone wants to get in on the ground floor when it comes to green hydrogen. Utilities and oil majors both have a head start with their mixture of renewable power capacity, gas transmission assets and&nbsp;an existing set of end users.</p>\n\n<p>But chemical manufacturers could be&nbsp;a third class of big green hydrogen players. <a href=\"https://www.worldgbc.org/news-media/akzonobel-unveils-plans-build-europes-largest-green-hydrogen-plant\" target=\"_blank\">AkzoNobel</a>&nbsp;began investigating&nbsp;a 20-megawatt electrolyzer as far back as 2018. U.S. industrial gases firm Air Products is planning what would be the world&#39;s largest green hydrogen complex, a <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/us-firm-unveils-worlds-largest-green-hydrogen-project\" target=\"_blank\">4-gigawatt</a>&nbsp;facility in Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p>On Tuesday, chemical giant Ineos joined the green hydrogen fray,&nbsp;announcing that its Inovyn subsidiary <a href=\"https://www.inovyn.com/news/ineos-launches-a-new-clean-hydrogen-business/\" target=\"_blank\">will launch</a> a&nbsp;business unit aiming to hit the lowest production costs yet recorded for the zero-carbon fuel. It will be&nbsp;headed&nbsp;by Wouter Bleukx, who is transferring over from Inovyn&rsquo;s chlor and alkali business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Chlorine&nbsp;is produced from salty water using&nbsp;giant electrolyzers that dwarf today&#39;s operational fleet of freshwater hydrogen electrolyzers. That could give&nbsp;Ineos and Inovyn a&nbsp;big advantage in making the shift to producing hydrogen via electrolysis, whether it&#39;s using electricity generated by renewable energy or other sources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It is clearly our ambition to produce hydrogen, preferably with alkaline water electrolyzers and renewable energy,&rdquo; Bleukx said in an interview with GTM. &ldquo;But at this stage, we do not exclude anything&nbsp;because we have to see how the technology develops&nbsp;over the next years.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, Inovyn is monitoring&nbsp;the progress of carbon capture technology for making blue hydrogen via natural-gas-fueled electrolysis. What path it takes could depend on the&nbsp;price of renewable energy as the deployment of new capacity continues.</p>\n\n<p>Bleukx said the chlorine and salt electrolyzers that it is used to working with are around 200 megawatts in size. That&rsquo;s an order of magnitude larger than any operational hydrogen electrolyzer, but the scope is well aligned to some of the larger green hydrogen projects that have been&nbsp;announced this year.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from its operational experience with electrolyzers, the company also manufactures them. It will make its own alkaline electrolyzers for hydrogen too, though it hasn&rsquo;t ruled out a partnership with an existing hydrogen electrolyzer maker. That could offer significant cost savings and in-house design&nbsp;advantages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But the two more determinant factors in the cost of green hydrogen production are the utilization rate of the electrolyzers and the price of electricity they will be using. Green hydrogen is<a href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/press-releases/green-hydrogen-cost-to-halve-by-2030---a-boost-to-south-koreas-hydrogen-ambitions/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;about four times as&nbsp;expensive</a>&nbsp;to produce as&nbsp;hydrogen derived from fossil fuels today.</p>\n\n<p>However, Wood Mackenzie expects the cost of green hydrogen to halve by 2030, largely driven by a&nbsp;patchwork of national hydrogen strategies around Europe&nbsp;and the EU&rsquo;s own <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/eu-sets-green-hydrogen-targets-now-blue-hydrogen-has-to-keep-up\" target=\"_blank\">2030 electrolyzer targets</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;40 gigawatts&nbsp;within its own borders and 40 GW just outside but importing into the EU.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Balancing hydrogen supply and demand</h2>\n\n<p>Keeping utilization rates high is a priority for green hydrogen production. In the early years, nascent&nbsp;and difficult-to-forecast demand will be a problem. Utilities&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.group.rwe/en/press/rwe-generation/get-h2-initiative-gives-go-ahead-for-germany-wide-hydrogen-infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">RWE</a>&nbsp;can look to create their own demand via vehicle charging&nbsp;or injection into the gas grid, while &Oslash;rsted is partnering with ammonia manufacturers, <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/bp-and-rsted-launch-green-hydrogen-partnership\" target=\"_blank\">oil players</a> and <a href=\"https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/orsted-to-power-decarbonization-hub-for-land-sea-and-air-transport\" target=\"_blank\">transportation</a> hubs.</p>\n\n<p>Oil majors also have their own demand. But the degree of alignment for hydrogen manufacture depends on their own in-house refining and petrochemical capabilities. BP recently sold off its petrochemicals business for $5 billion&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;to Ineos.</p>\n\n<p>Ineos is already producing 300,000 tons of hydrogen a year. The&nbsp;completion of its Project One facility in Antwerp will up that to 400,000 tons, Bleukx said. The vast majority of this is produced from gasification of fossil fuel feedstocks, however, rather than electrolysis, whether green or blue.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our ambition is to create strategic partnerships&nbsp;further downstream&nbsp;to make sure that we have big clusters where the hydrogen is produced and consumed at the same time,&rdquo; explained Bleukx. This existing hydrogen supply will enable it to serve customers now with decarbonized hydrogen added to the offering as it brings its (mostly)&nbsp;green hydrogen online.<br />\n<br />\nIneos, a British company operating <a href=\"https://www.ineos.com/locations/\" target=\"_blank\">127 sites</a> on four continents, was founded by Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who is the U.K.&rsquo;s richest person courtesy of his 60 percent ownership of the firm. Many of those 127 sites are in Europe&rsquo;s major industrial heartlands, perfectly placed to find other sources of demand for carbon-free hydrogen, an advantage it shares&nbsp;with oil majors.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s the starting point for what will be primarily a green hydrogen business. So&nbsp;does Inovyn&rsquo;s own demand give it an advantage over other would-be hydrogen players?</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. I think one of the challenges, not only for us but for many who go into the hydrogen business, is to have a good supply-and-demand balance to optimally produce and consume this hydrogen. It will be one of the key issues,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Bleukx.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We certainly have the experience and the know-how to build not only electrolyzers but also everything around that because we have done many of these big projects.\"</p>\n\n<p>Ineos&rsquo; rapid growth essentially involved buying struggling chemicals facilities, investing&nbsp;in them where necessary and slashing excess costs. Ineos recorded revenue of $85 billion in 2019. For comparison, U.S.-based chemicals giant&nbsp;Dow&nbsp;posted revenue of $43 billion in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>So with scale and experience on its side, is Bleukx confident that the company can drive down the cost of green hydrogen sooner than current forecasts estimate?</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to say at this stage, but of course it is our ambition&nbsp;at Ineos&nbsp;to be the cost leader in everything we do&nbsp;&mdash; it&rsquo;s in our DNA,&rdquo; he said.</p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=OcfU4kDxjbs:H8-VNE8ivic:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=OcfU4kDxjbs:H8-VNE8ivic:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=OcfU4kDxjbs:H8-VNE8ivic:V_sGLiPBpWU\" border=\"0\"></img></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?a=OcfU4kDxjbs:H8-VNE8ivic:gIN9vFwOqvQ\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/GreentechMedia?i=OcfU4kDxjbs:H8-VNE8ivic:gIN9vFwOqvQ\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GreentechMedia/~4/OcfU4kDxjbs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
